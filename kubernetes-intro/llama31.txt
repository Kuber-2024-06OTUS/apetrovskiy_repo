>>> Please create a Kubernetes manifest for namespace called ns1 and a Pod manif

Here are the Kubernetes manifests you requested:

**Namespace manifest**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ns1
```

**Pod manifest**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8000
      hostPort: 8000
      name: nginx-port
    volumeMounts:
    - name: common-volume
      mountPath: /ns1
  initContainers:
  - name: init-container
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["sh", "-c"]
    args:
    - "echo 'Hello World!' > /init/index.html"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: common-volume
      mountPath: /init
  volumes:
  - name: common-volume
    emptyDir: {}
  lifecycle:
    postStart:
      exec:
        command: ["sh", "-c"]
        args:
        - "rm /ns1/index.html"
```

Let me explain what's going on in this manifest:

* The namespace `ns1` is created with a simple YAML file.
* The pod `nginx-pod` is created in the `ns1` namespace. It has two 
containers: an `nginx-container` running the official Nginx image, and an 
`init-container` running Busybox.
* The `nginx-container` listens on port 8000 and exposes it to the host 
machine.
* Both containers share a volume called `common-volume`, which is stored 
in ephemeral storage (using `emptyDir`). This means that the data will be 
lost when the pod is deleted. The `/ns1` directory in the 
`nginx-container` is mounted from this shared volume, and so is the 
`/init` directory in the `init-container`.
* In the `init-container`, a simple command is run to create an 
`index.html` file in the `/init` directory.
* In the pod's lifecycle configuration, a post-start hook is defined that 
removes the `index.html` file from the `/ns1` directory. This will happen 
whenever the pod starts.

Note that this manifest uses ephemeral storage for the shared volume. If 
you want to persist data across restarts, you'll need to use a Persistent 
Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

>>> Please provide me with the command line (Linux shell) to run these manifests
...  so that the port is available on the host computer and how to test it
To apply these manifests and make the port available on the host computer, 
you'll need to use the `kubectl` command-line tool. Here are the steps:

**1. Create the namespace**

```bash
kubectl create -f ns1-namespace.yaml
```

Replace `ns1-namespace.yaml` with the actual file name where you saved the 
first manifest.

**2. Apply the pod manifest**

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

Again, replace `nginx-pod.yaml` with the actual file name where you saved 
the second manifest.

**3. Get the IP address of the pod**

To find the IP address of the running pod, run:

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o wide --namespace ns1
```

This will show you the pod's status and its IP address.

**4. Port-forward to access the pod on your host computer**

Use `kubectl port-forward` to expose the container's port (8000) on a 
local machine:

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-pod -n ns1 8000:8000 &
```

The `-p 8000:8000` argument tells `kubectl` to forward traffic from your 
host's port 8000 to the container's port 8000. The `&` at the end runs 
this command in the background.

**5. Test the pod**

Open a new terminal window and use `curl` or your favorite web browser to 
access the pod:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ns1/
```

You should see the Nginx welcome page, but since we didn't configure 
anything yet, it will likely be the default "Welcome to nginx!" message. 
Try accessing a specific directory by modifying the URL:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/ns1/init/
```

This should return an error because we haven't configured our pod to serve 
files from that directory.

**6. Verify file removal on pod exit**

To test the file removal functionality, you can delete the pod (be careful 
not to delete the namespace!) and observe how the `index.html` file is 
removed:

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx-pod --namespace ns1
```

After deleting the pod, check if the file still exists in your shared 
volume directory. The command for this will depend on your local 
environment; you can use something like `find` to search for files in a 
specific directory.

That's it! You've successfully applied a Kubernetes manifest and made a 
port available on your host computer.
